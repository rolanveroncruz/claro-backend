<p>The legal framework surrounding psychological incapacity primarily arises from Article 36 of the Family Code of the Philippines, which states that a marriage contracted by a party who, at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated to comply with essential marital obligations, shall be void. This provision does not provide a specific definition of psychological incapacity, thus requiring interpretation through precedent and judicial guidelines. </p>
<p>Significant legal documents that inform the prevailing laws on psychological incapacity include key cases decided by the Philippine Supreme Court, notably <em>Santos v. Court of Appeals</em> (1995) and <em>Molina v. Court of Appeals</em> (1997).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Santos v. Court of Appeals (1995)</strong> established the foundational understanding of psychological incapacity. The Court noted that psychological incapacity must be characterized by:</li>
<li><strong>Gravity</strong>: The incapacity must be serious enough to prevent the individual from carrying out the normal duties required in a marriage.</li>
<li><strong>Juridical Antecedence</strong>: The condition must have existed prior to or at the time of marriage, even if its effects only became evident afterward.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Incurability</strong>: The incapacity must be persistent and permanent, meaning that treatment or recovery is not a feasible option (G.R. No. 126010, December 8, 1999).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Molina v. Court of Appeals (1997)</strong> delineated eight guidelines for assessing claims of psychological incapacity, reinforcing the principles set out in <em>Santos</em> while clarifying that the incapacity is a legal construct rather than strictly a medical one. Unlike diagnoses that are defined in medical terms, psychological incapacity encompasses a broader range of conditions and is evaluated based not merely on psychological disorders but also on the individual's life experiences and personal context (G.R. No. 220303).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recent Interpretations</strong>: In <em>Tan-Andal v. Andal</em> (2021), the Supreme Court revisited the application of psychological incapacity, moving away from the rigid requirements previously established by <em>Molina</em>. The Court emphasized a more nuanced interpretation that relies on the totality of evidence rather than specific medical diagnostics. It acknowledged that the root cause of psychological incapacity need not be exclusively identified as a personality disorder nor clinically proven (G.R. No. 247985).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The courts have often referred back to these landmark rulings to determine how psychological incapacity is interpreted within legal proceedings, particularly in matrimonial contexts. Additionally, the jurisprudence showcases that expert testimony, while valuable, is not the sole determinant of psychological incapacity; the courts are encouraged to holistically evaluate the circumstances of each individual case (G.R. No. 196359).</p>
<p>In summary, the legal documents and cases that shape the understanding of psychological incapacity include Article 36 of the Family Code, alongside significant Supreme Court decisions such as <em>Santos v. Court of Appeals</em> and <em>Molina v. Court of Appeals</em>, with ongoing refinements in recent court rulings like <em>Tan-Andal v. Andal</em>. These documents collectively guide courts in interpreting psychological incapacity, emphasizing its legal essence and the need for a comprehensive examination of each case.</p>
