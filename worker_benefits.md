This pay is calculated at a minimum of 25% of the regular wage for ordinary days, and up to 30% for work rendered on regular holidays, special days, or employees' rest days (Labor Code, Article 87).
4. **Premium Pay**: Workers who work on a special day declared by the President receive an additional 30% of their daily rate, and if this coincides with their rest day, they are entitled to a total of 50% more (G.R. No. 218010 Feb 2023).

6. **Maternity Benefits**: Female employees are entitled to paid maternity leave, which is 60 days for normal delivery and 78 days for cesarean delivery, as mandated by the Social Security Law (Republic Act No. 8282) (G.R. No. 202275 Jul 2018).
7. **Paternity Leave**: Male employees are entitled to seven days of paid paternity leave (Republic Act No. 8187) which can be availed around childbirth of their legitimate spouse (G.R. No. 218010 Feb 2023).
8. **Retirement Pay**: An employee who retires is entitled to retirement pay under Republic Act No. 7641, or based on any bonafide retirement plan that provides greater benefits (BWC DEPARTMENT ORDER NO. 40 Nov 1994).
9. **Termination Pay**: If an employee's separation from the company is due to an authorized cause, they are entitled to termination pay, which is usually computed depending on their length of service (Labor Code, Article 298).
10. **Health Coverage**: Workers are also entitled to benefits provided by Social Security System (SSS), PhilHealth, and the Home Development Mutual Fund (Pag-IBIG Fund) in accordance with laws pertaining to these benefits (Republic Act No. 11996) (G.R. No. 229396 Jun 2021).

These benefits reflect the commitment of the Philippine government to protect workers' rights and ensure fair and humane working conditions. It is important for both employers and workers to be aware of these rights and responsibilities under the law.
