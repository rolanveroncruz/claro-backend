Based on the retrieved context, here's a breakdown of the legal documents and concepts relevant to psychological incapacity:
1.  **Article 36 of the Family Code:** This is the primary legal provision that addresses psychological incapacity as a ground for declaring a marriage void ab initio (void from the beginning) (G.R. No. 108763 Feb 1997, G.R. No. 196359 May 2021, G.R. No. 253993 Oct 2023). The article states: "A marriage contracted by any party who, at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations of marriage, shall likewise be void even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization" (G.R. No. 108763 Feb 1997).
2.  **Canon Law:** Article 36 owes its roots to Canon Law (G.R. No. 108763 Feb 1997, G.R. No. 196359 May 2021). The Civil Law Revision Committee incorporated the Canon Law concept of psychological incapacity into the Family Code (G.R. No. 108763 Feb 1997, G.R. No. 161793 Feb 2009). Decisions of church tribunals may be given persuasive effect, although not binding on civil courts, since the provision was taken from Canon Law (G.R. No. 196359 May 2021, G.R. No. 247985 Oct 2021). Canon 1095 of the New Code of Canon Law is specifically mentioned as related to Article 36 (G.R. No. 164493 Mar 2010, G.R. No. 203284 Nov 2016). The Old Canon Law (1917) indirectly recognized psychological incapacity through a combination of three old canons (G.R. No. 108763 Feb 1997, G.R. No. 161793 Feb 2009).
3.  **Santos v. Court of Appeals:** This 1995 case (310 Phil 22, 39 (1995)) is a landmark decision where the Court first defined "psychological incapacity" (G.R. No. 155800 Mar 2006, G.R. No. 164493 Mar 2010, G.R. No. 228127 Mar 2023). It stated that psychological incapacity must be characterized by gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability (G.R. No. 164493 Mar 2010, G.R. No. 196359 May 2021, G.R. No. 226907 Jul 2019). The Court described it as a mental incapacity that causes a party to be truly incognitive of the basic marital covenants, confined to the most serious cases of personality disorders (G.R. No. 164493 Mar 2010, G.R. No. 228127 Mar 2023).
4.  **Republic v. Court of Appeals and Molina (Molina):** This case laid down guidelines for interpreting and applying Article 36 (G.R. No. 164493 Mar 2010, G.R. No. 203284 Nov 2016). These guidelines have been revisited and refined over time (G.R. No. 196359 May 2021). Some cases have noted that the *Molina* guidelines have been applied too rigidly (G.R. No. 196359 May 2021, G.R. No. 226907 Jul 2019).
5.  **Tan-Andal v. Andal:** This more recent case (G.R. No. 247985 Oct 2021) provides a comprehensive interpretation of psychological incapacity and modifies the *Molina* guidelines (G.R. No. 222908 Dec 2021, G.R. No. 246933 Mar 2023). It abandoned the requirements that the root cause of psychological incapacity be medically or clinically identified and incurable (G.R. No. 222908 Dec 2021).
6.  **Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V):** This manual, used by clinicians for assessments and diagnosis of mental disorders, may be considered (G.R. No. 196359 May 2021). It is the authoritative listing of mental disorders recognized by the scientific community (G.R. No. 253993 Oct 2023).
7.  **Jurisprudence (Case Law):** Numerous cases have contributed to the evolving understanding of psychological incapacity. Some examples include:
    *   Hernandez v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 126010 Dec 1999)
    *   Dedel v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 151867 Jan 2004)
    *   Pesca v. Pesca (G.R. No. 136921 Apr 2001)
    *   Republic v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 109975 Feb 2001)
    *    Simundac-Keppel v. Keppel, G.R. No. 202039, August 14, 2019
    * Eliscupidez v. Eliscupidez, G.R. No. 226907, July 22, 2019
    *   Cahapisan-Santiago v. Santiago, G.R. No. 241144, June 26, 2019
    *   Cortez v. Correz, G.R. No. 224638, April 10, 2019
    *   Go-Yu v. Yu, G.R. No. 230443, April 3, 2019
    *  Republic v. Deang, G.R. No. 236279, March 25, 2019
8.  **Rules on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Marriage (A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC):** Section 2(d) of this rule is relevant, particularly regarding the need for expert testimony (G.R. No. 196359 May 2021).
In summary, while Article 36 of the Family Code is the core legal document, its interpretation relies heavily on jurisprudence, particularly the *Santos*, *Molina*, and *Tan-Andal* cases. Canon Law also provides a historical and persuasive context.
