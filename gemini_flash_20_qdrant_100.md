<p>Based on the retrieved context, the following legal documents and principles are relevant when discussing the prevailing laws on psychological incapacity:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Article 36 of the Family Code:</strong> This article declares a marriage void if one party was psychologically incapacitated to comply with essential marital obligations at the time of the celebration, even if the incapacity becomes manifest only afterward (G.R. No. 108763 Feb 1997, G.R. No. 196359 May 2021).</li>
<li><strong>Canon Law:</strong> Article 36 owes its roots to Canon Law (G.R. No. 108763 Feb 1997, G.R. No. 196359 May 2021). The provision was taken from Canon Law (G.R. No. 108763 Feb 1997, G.R. No. 155800 Mar 2006).</li>
<li><strong>Molina Guidelines (Republic v. Court of Appeals):</strong> These guidelines, established in <em>Republic v. Court of Appeals</em>, provide a framework for courts in adjudicating petitions for declaration of nullity under Article 36 (G.R. No. 155800 Mar 2006).</li>
<li><strong>Santos v. Court of Appeals:</strong> This case defined psychological incapacity as a mental incapacity that causes a party to be truly incognitive of the basic marital covenants and outlined that psychological incapacity must be characterized by (a) gravity; (b) juridical antecedence; and (c) incurability (G.R. No. 155800 Mar 2006, G.R. No. 164493 Mar 2010, G.R. No. 196359 May 2021, G.R. No. 226907 Jul 2019).</li>
<li><strong>Tan-Andal v. Andal:</strong> This case provides a comprehensive interpretation of psychological incapacity and modifies the <em>Molina</em> guidelines (G.R. No. 247985 Oct 2021, G.R. No. 222908 Dec 2021).</li>
</ol>
<p>These cases and guidelines emphasize that psychological incapacity is a legal, not a medical, concept. The courts should interpret the provision on a case-to-case basis, guided by experience, the findings of experts and researchers in psychological disciplines, and decisions of church tribunals (G.R. No. 196359 May 2021).</p>
