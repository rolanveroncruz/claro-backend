The prevailing laws on psychological incapacity are primarily outlined in Article 36 of the Family Code of the Philippines, which states:
> "A marriage contracted by any party who, at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations of marriage, shall likewise be void even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization."
This legal concept has evolved through various cases interpreted by the Philippine Supreme Court. Key judicial rulings, especially **Santos v. Court of Appeals (1995)** and **Republic v. Court of Appeals and Molina (1997)**, provide the foundational legal framework regarding psychological incapacity. Here are the essential legal documents and principles discussed in those contexts:
1. **Santos v. Court of Appeals (1995)**: This case provided the first detailed judicial definition of psychological incapacity, establishing that it must be characterized by:
   - **Gravity**: The incapacity must be severe enough to prevent a party from fulfilling marital duties.
   - **Juridical Antecedence**: The incapacity must have existed prior to or at the time of marriage.
   - **Incurability**: The condition must be permanent, meaning it cannot be remedied.
   
   The ruling stressed that psychological incapacity refers to mental incapacity that prevents a party from fully understanding the nature of marriage obligations.
2. **Molina v. Court of Appeals (1997)**: This case further clarified the standards for establishing psychological incapacity with extensive guidelines known as the **Molina Guidelines**. The court ruled that while expert testimony from psychologists or psychiatrists may assist, it is not necessarily required to establish psychological incapacity in every case. Psychological incapacity does not equate to a personality disorder, as it is seen as a legal concept rather than a strictly medical one, allowing room for judicial interpretation based on case specifics.
3. **Tan-Andal v. Andal (2021)**: This case revisited and modified the guidelines set in Molina, aiming to address criticisms regarding its strictness. The court emphasized that psychological incapacity does not have to be "medically or clinically identified," thus freeing it from rigid medical definitions and allowing for a broader interpretation.
4. **Civil Code Revision Committee Deliberations**: The legislative intent behind Article 36 was that the term "psychological incapacity," taken from Canon Law, was deliberately left undefined to allow judges to interpret it flexibly based on evolving societal norms, psychological insights, and individual circumstances.
5. **Evolving Standards**: The courts have reiterated the need for case-by-case assessment, guided by the findings of psychological experts as well as the evolving conceptual understanding of psychological incapacity. Justice Caguioa and other jurists have highlighted that psychological incapacity encompasses a broad range of severe dysfunctions that only need to be established through compelling evidence.
In summary, the prevailing legal documentation regarding psychological incapacity revolves around Article 36 of the Family Code, elaborated through case law specifically in **Santos** and **Molina**. These rulings emphasize the legal nature of psychological incapacity, detaching it from strictly medical definitions and underscoring its assessment through a nuanced understanding informed by expert opinions and individual circumstances. The courts encourage a flexible interpretation that aligns with the underlying intent of providing realism and relevance to marital laws, reflective of each unique case.
